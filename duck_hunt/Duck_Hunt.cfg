#####  LANGUE  #################################################################

# Please refer to the beginning of the Duck_Hunt.tcl file for
# the language configuration.



#####  COMPORTEMENT DES CANARDS  ###############################################

# Number of ducks per day per chan.
variable number_of_ducks_per_day 48

# Approximate number of super ducks per day per chan.
# This number is approximate since subject to the laws of probability, there will be
# so "roughly" the desired number of super-ducks per day.
# Super-ducks are also ducks and are therefore counted in
# number_of_ducks_per_day; for this reason, there can be no more super-
# ducks than ducks.
# A super duck is harder to kill, gives more xp and cannot be
# scared.
variable approx_number_of_golden_ducks_per_day 4

# Minimum number of health points of a super duck.
# Each hit point will require a shot.
variable golden_duck_min_HP 3

# Maximum number of health points of a super-duck.
# Each hit point will require a shot.
variable golden_duck_max_HP 5

# And the ducks, they never sleep?
# You can define one or more hours during which there will be no
# of ducks taking flight.
# These times must be preceded by a 0 when they are less than 10.
# Exemple : variable duck_sleep_hours {02 03 04 05}
variable duck_sleep_hours {}

# And the ducks, they never sleep?
# You can define one or more hours during which there will be no
# of ducks taking flight.
# These times must be preceded by a 0 when they are less than 10.# Method used to determine when a duck should fly:
# 1 = Every minute there are "number_of_ducks_per_day" chances out of 1440 for
#   that a duck flies away.
#   With this method, the laws of probability apply; so there will be
#   "roughly" the desired number of ducks per day and fledging times
#   will be unpredictable.
# 2 = Flight times are determined in advance and distributed in such a way
#   relatively homogeneous throughout the day.
#   Allows to have exactly "number_of_ducks_per_day" ducks per day.
#   Allows an Eggdrop admin to know the times in advance
#   flight
variable method 2

# After how many shots does the duck run away scared? (-1 = unlimited)
variable shots_before_duck_flee 3

# Should successful shots also scare other ducks in flight?
# Note: If you set this parameter to 0, only the most missed shots
# frighten. (0 = no / 1 = yes)
variable successful_shots_also_scares_ducks 1

# How long can the duck be shot before it escapes?
# (in seconds)
variable escape_time 300

# Should the number of chargers be unlimited? (0 = no / 1 = yes)
variable unlimited_ammo_clips 0



##### HUNTING ACCIDENTS and HUNTER MANAGEMENT ###########################

# Flags that will be exempt from the risk of taking a stray ball.

# If for example you want to exclude the a and o flags, put "ao".
# If you don't want to exclude anyone, put ""
variable exempted_flags "b"

# Percentage of chance of accidentally hitting another player in the event of a shot

# If there are more than 30 people on the channel:
variable chances_to_hit_someone_else_31_ 15

# Percentage of chance of accidentally hitting another player in the event of a shot
# wild or ricochet, if there is no duck on the chan.
# Note: we differentiate this case to discourage players from trying to
# draw at random with the aim of reaching other users.
# If there are between 1 and 10 people on the channel:
variable chances_wild_fire_hit_someone_1_10 1
# If there are between 11 and 20 people on the chan:
variable chances_wild_fire_hit_someone_11_20 2

variable chances_wild_fire_hit_someone_21_30 3
# If there are more than 30 people on the channel:
variable chances_wild_fire_hit_someone_31_ 4

# Percentage chance of hitting the duck after the bullet ricochets.
variable chances_to_ricochet_towards_duck 10

# Maximum number of ricochets.
# Once this number is reached, the ball has lost all its energy and falls.
variable max_ricochets 5

# Should we kick hunters who shoot irresponsibly while

# to deflect it should it be kicked?

# If your server uses Anope or Epona services, you can set this
# parameter so that kicks are performed by ChanServ.
# (0 = kicks by Eggdrop / 1 = kicks by Chanserv)
variable kick_method 0

# Do you want only hunters (i.e. users
# with statistics) can be victims of hunting accidents?
# (0 = all users can have a hunting accident / 1 = only
# hunters can have a hunting accident)
variable only_hunters_can_be_shot 0

# Should we confiscate our weapon from players who touch someone else by
# accident ? (0 = non / 1 = oui)

# Should we confiscate our weapon to players who open fire in the absence of
# canard ? (0 = non / 1 = oui)
variable gun_confiscation_on_wild_fire 1

# Should confiscated weapons be returned:
#1 - automatically every day at a specified time

variable gun_hand_back_mode 2

# Activate anti-highlight system? (0 = no / 1 = yes)
# When the anti-hl system is activated, the graphical representation of the flight
# of the ducks will be randomly generated each time in order to thwart attempts to
# highlight the ducks or automate shooting through a script.
# If this option is disabled, all ducks will be identical to the following model:
# -.,žž.-·°'`'°·-.,žž.-·°'`'°· \_O<   COIN
variable hl_prevention 0

# Activate anti-circumvention system for weapon confiscation?
# (0 = no / 1 = yes)
# When this system is enabled and the statistics of two users are automatically merged,
# if the user with whom we are merging no longer has a weapon while the current user has
# one, the statistics of the latter will not be taken into account.
# In the case where the merge occurs between two users who are both disarmed,
# the statistics of the one with the least XP will not be taken into account.
variable confiscation_enforcement_on_fusion 0

# manages to hit a duck after one or more ricochets.

#			granted by the different levels never result in a value < 0% or > 100%.
#		- The number of points required to advance to the next level after the
#			highest level must require 9999999999 experience points.
#		- In the packs, message m134 must contain as many titles as there are levels.
